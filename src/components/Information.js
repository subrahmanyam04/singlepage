                A paragraph of placeholder text. We're using it here to show the use of the clearfix class. We're adding quite a few meaningless phrases here to demonstrate how the columns interact here with the floated image.

                As you can see the paragraphs gracefully wrap around the floated image.

It simply takes up space and should not really be read.
